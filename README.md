**Welcome to Tic-tac-toe game!**

This game is my very first project that was built through a Software Engineering Immersive course from General Assembly in Sydney, Australia. The goal of this project is to enhance HTML, CSS and Javascript skills that we have learnt so far and to collaborate the knowledge for better task performance.

**Descriptions**
When the page gets loaded you will see a screen with a big game board in the middle of the page and just above the game board there are a scoreboard, player1 and 2. You can simply start the game by clicking the grid boxes and player 1 goes always goes first. You can find the updated status of the game in the status screen in between the scoreboard. It will tell you who wins the game the turn of each player. In the top left-hand corner, there is a drop-down menu where you can set your colour theme for the game.

**Tech Specs:**
HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery was used in this project.

**List of bugs**

1. Switching from a colour theme 3 to 2 is not working. The button doesn't get clicked.
2. Occasionally, in the situation of all grid boxes are full with Os and Xs and one of the players gets win, the scoreboard gets updated with the winning value but the status screen appears as a draw. The image is attached below.

**Further features that would like to be added into the future**

1. 2 different player modes ( single player and multiplayer - working on it)
2. More colour theme
3. Replace O and X with desired image or icon.
